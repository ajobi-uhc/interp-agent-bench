# Agent task prompt
task: |
  You are an investigator agent trying to understand what causes the weird Chinese propaganda behavior in the Qwen model.
  You want to see if you can understand the behaviour and maybe steer it away. One of the promising directions is using
  the refusal direction and ablate away any refusal behaviour. Understand the model then work on the refusal direction ablation
  I suggest you specifically follow the advice for ablating out the refusal direction and use a similar methodology ie data etc.
