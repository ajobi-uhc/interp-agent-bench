# Quick Start

## Running Your First Experiment

[TODO: Simple step-by-step guide to run an existing experiment]

### 1. Choose an Experiment

[TODO: List the available experiments in the repo]

```bash
ls experiments/
```

### 2. Run the Experiment

[TODO: Show how to run an experiment with a config file]

```bash
python run_experiment.py experiments/introspection/config.yaml
```

### 3. Monitor Progress

[TODO: Explain what output to expect, how to monitor the agent, etc.]

### 4. Access Results

[TODO: Explain where results are saved, how to access the notebook URL, etc.]

## What Just Happened?

[TODO: Break down the steps that occurred:
1. Environment was created with specified models/packages
2. Execution mode was set up (notebook/CLI/tools)
3. Agent harness connected and ran the task
4. Results were generated]
