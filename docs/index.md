# Sena


## What is Sena?
Sena (Sandboxed environments for agents) is a minimal hacakble library designed for interpretability researchers that want to do experiments with agents
- Define replicable environments for agents to run in and run tasks (eg. replicate anthropics introspection paper)
- Allows you to define and use agents interactively to do interp research tasks  (eg. steering against eval awareness)


## Example Use Cases

[TODO: Add the use cases from README:
- Replicate experiments from papers and get notebook URLs to play with
- Run investigation or auditing tasks with custom scaffolds
- Benchmark techniques against others with different execution environments]

## Quick Links

## Architecture Overview

[TODO: High-level diagram or description of how Environment → Execution → Harness work together]

Task Definition → Environment Setup → Execution Mode → Agent Harness → Results
