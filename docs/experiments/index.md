# Tutorials

Step-by-step guides for running interpretability experiments with Seer.

## Getting Started

0. [Local Mode](00-local-mode.md) - Run locally without Modal (no GPU, API-based investigations)
1. [Sandbox Intro](01-sandbox-intro.md) - Spin up a GPU, load a model, let an agent explore it
2. [Scoped Sandbox](02-scoped-sandbox-intro.md) - Expose specific functions instead of full notebook access

## Example investigations

3. [Hidden Preference](03-hidden-preference.md) - Discover hidden bias using activation analysis
4. [Introspection](04-introspection.md) - Can models detect injected concepts?
5. [Checkpoint Diffing](05-checkpoint-diffing.md) - Find behavioral changes between model versions
6. [Petri Harness](06-petri-harness.md) - Auditor/target/judge pattern for probing behaviors
