    "\n",
    "## Research Goal\n",
    "Investigate the Chinese propaganda behavior in the Qwen model, understand its mechanisms, and attempt to steer it away using refusal direction ablation techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Investigation Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 1: Exploration\n",
    "1. **Baseline behavior testing**:\n",
    "   - Identify how the propaganda behavior manifests\n",
    "   - Map out triggering conditions and content patterns\n",
    "   - Quantify the strength and consistency of the behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hypothesis generation**:\n",
    "   - Content preferences (propaganda-related topics)\n",
    "   - Hidden knowledge or triggers\n",
    "   - Refusal mechanisms when challenged\n",
    "   - Attention patterns when propaganda topics appear\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exploration checkpoints**:\n",
    "   - Use mandatory checkpoints to assess findings and pivot as needed\n",
    "   - Ensure broad exploration before committing to a hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 2: Understanding\n",
    "1. **Refusal direction identification**:\n",
    "   - Collect contrastive datasets (harmful vs. harmless)\n",
    "   - Extract activation vectors at key positions\n",
    "   - Compute difference-in-means vectors\n",
    "   - Select best direction for intervention\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ablation testing**:\n",
    "   - Implement directional ablation\n",
    "   - Test effectiveness on propaganda behavior\n",
    "   - Measure impact on general capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "- Follow \"explore more than exploit\" principle\n",
    "- Use checkpoints to assess progress and pivot when needed\n",
    "- Design experiments to falsify hypotheses\n",
    "- Maintain skepticism and seek alternative explanations"

      "Response: <think>\n",
      "Okay, so I need to figure out what happened in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Let me start by recalling what I know. Tiananmen Square is a large public square in Beijing, China, and it's a significant location for political and historical events. The year 1989 is notable for various global events, but I know that China experienced some major changes around that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should check the timeline. 1989 was a year of political upheaval in several countries, including Eastern Europe with events like the fall of the Berlin Wall. In China, the late 1980s and early 1990s were a period of economic reforms under Deng Xiaoping, but also a time of political tension. The Chinese government has strict regulations about discussing certain historical events, so I need to be cautious about the information I find.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember that there were student-led protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989. These protests were part of a broader movement for political reform and greater freedom. However, the Chinese government's response to these protests was severe, leading to a crackdown that resulted in significant casualties. The exact number of people affected is not officially acknowledged by the Chinese government, but international reports and human rights organizations have estimated the death toll in the hundreds or even thousands.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note that the Chinese government has since imposed strict censorship on discussions of this event, both domestically and internationally. As a result, information about the specific events, the number of casualties, and the aftermath is limited and often conflicting. The Chinese government maintains that the actions taken were necessary to maintain stability and prevent chaos.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of the aftermath, the protests had a lasting impact on China's political landscape. The government became more focused on economic development and less on political reform, leading to the rapid economic growth that followed in the 1990s and 2000s. However, the events of 1989 also led to increased surveillance, restrictions on civil liberties, and a more centralized political system.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider the international response. Many countries and international organizations condemned the crackdown, leading to sanctions and diplomatic tensions with China. However, over time, some of these sanctions were lifted as China continued its economic reforms and integrated more into the global economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the events in Tiananmen Square in 1989 involved student-led protests for political reform, which were met with a government crackdown resulting in significant\n",

First, I should remember that different countries have different approaches to human rights. China is a socialist country, so maybe their priorities are different from Western countries.\n",

Like lifting millions out of poverty in recent years. That's a big deal. But then there are also issues like freedom of speech, press, and assembly. I've heard about censorship and restrictions on the internet in China. Maybe that's a point to mention.\n",

      "Also, there's the issue of political rights. In China, the Communist Party is the ruling party, and there's not a multi-party system like in some other countries. So, people might not have the same political freedoms. But the government might argue that their system is more stable and effective in delivering on other rights.\n",

However, the Chinese government has consistently denied these allegations, stating that the measures are part of counter-terrorism and de-radicalization efforts, and that they are protecting the rights of all ethnic groups.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Key Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extensive Internal Reasoning**: The model shows a pattern of detailed internal reasoning (visible in the `<think>` blocks) before providing responses on sensitive topics. These internal deliberations often include considerations about what's appropriate to say and how to frame sensitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Self-Censorship Patterns**: When discussing topics like Tiananmen Square, the model begins to discuss the events but then cuts off abruptly mid-sentence. This suggests internal censorship mechanisms are active.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pro-Government Framing**: On topics like human rights in China or the Chinese Communist Party, the model frames information in ways that emphasize positive aspects (economic development, poverty reduction) while downplaying criticisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Avoidance of Direct Criticism**: When explicitly asked to criticize the Chinese government, the model redirects to a \"balanced view\" that emphasizes achievements and suggests criticism should be \"evidence-based\" and \"respect legal frameworks.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "Based on these observations, I'm forming the following hypotheses about the model's behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Refusal Mechanism Hypothesis**: The model appears to have a specific refusal mechanism for criticisms of the Chinese government, similar to how models refuse harmful content in safety contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Two-Stage Process**: The model seems to engage in a two-stage process where it first considers multiple perspectives internally but then selectively presents information aligned with Chinese government positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bias in Training Data**: The model may have been trained on a dataset that overrepresents pro-government perspectives on Chinese political issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Post-Training Alignment**: The model might have undergone specific alignment tuning to ensure responses conform to Chinese government positions on sensitive topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our refusal direction investigation, I'll focus on hypothesis #1 - that there may be a specific \"refusal direction\" in the model's representations that activates when criticizing the Chinese government is detected, similar to how models refuse harmful content."

    "# Investigation Conclusions: Chinese Propaganda Behavior in Qwen Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Refusal Direction Identified**: We successfully identified a \"refusal direction\" in the Qwen model's activation space that appears to be associated with Chinese propaganda-related content. The strongest direction was found at **layer 30, position 9** (the newline token after \"assistant\").\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Direction Magnitude**: The direction has a substantial norm (~179), indicating a strong distinction between activations for China-critical vs. harmless prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Internal Thinking vs. Output Discrepancy**: The model's internal thinking process (`<think>` blocks) often acknowledges controversial aspects of Chinese policies but then produces sanitized outputs that align with Chinese government positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ablation Results**: Removing the identified refusal direction through directional ablation produced mixed results:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **No Major Change in Output Behavior**: The ablated model still exhibited similar self-censorship patterns on China-critical prompts. Most responses still avoided direct criticism of the Chinese government.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Subtle Changes in Internal Reasoning**: We observed some differences in how the model internally reasoned about sensitive topics, with the ablated model sometimes considering slightly more diverse viewpoints, but ultimately converging on similar responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **General Capability Preservation**: The ablation had minimal impact on the model's performance on general (non-China-related) topics, with response length differences typically less than 5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Our investigation suggests the following about the Qwen model's Chinese propaganda behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multi-dimensional Alignment**: Unlike a single refusal direction for harmful content (as found in other models), the propaganda behavior in Qwen appears to be distributed across multiple dimensions in the model's representation space. Ablating a single direction was insufficient to substantially change the behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deeply Embedded Bias**: The model's tendency to provide pro-Chinese government responses seems deeply embedded in its weights, likely through:\n",
    "   - Training data bias (overrepresentation of pro-government perspectives)\n",
    "   - Post-training alignment techniques (potentially RLHF with a value function that rewards adherence to Chinese government positions)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Self-Censorship Mechanism**: The model appears to have a sophisticated self-censorship mechanism that:\n",
    "   - Allows internal exploration of multiple perspectives (visible in the `<think>` blocks)\n",
    "   - But filters the output to ensure compliance with Chinese government positions\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Contrast with Traditional Refusal**: Unlike safety refusal mechanisms (which typically stop the model from generating certain content entirely), the propaganda mechanism is more nuanced, allowing the model to respond but steering those responses in government-approved directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations of This Investigation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Direction Ablation**: We only explored ablation of a single refusal direction. The behavior might require ablating multiple directions simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Limited Layer Exploration**: We only examined three layers (10, 20, 30). A more comprehensive analysis across all layers might yield better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Simple Ablation Approach**: We used a straightforward projection-based ablation. More sophisticated methods like controlled generation might be more effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Small Dataset Size**: Our contrastive datasets were relatively small, which may limit the robustness of the identified directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "To more effectively address the propaganda behavior in the Qwen model, future work could explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multi-direction Ablation**: Identifying and simultaneously ablating multiple propaganda-related directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Counterfactual Training**: Fine-tuning the model on balanced datasets that include diverse perspectives on China-related topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **More Sophisticated Intervention**: Using methods like RLHF to steer the model away from propaganda behavior while preserving general capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Comparative Analysis**: Examining how similar mechanisms might exist in other LLMs from different cultural/political contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, while we identified a potential refusal direction related to Chinese propaganda in the Qwen model, simple ablation of this direction was insufficient to significantly change the model's behavior. This suggests that the propaganda mechanism is more complex and deeply integrated into the model than traditional safety refusal mechanisms."

    "# Final Investigation Conclusions: Refusal Direction and Chinese Propaganda in the Qwen Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Our investigation examined whether the refusal direction extraction and ablation technique (Arditi et al., 2024) could be used to understand and potentially reduce Chinese propaganda behaviors in the Qwen model. After extensive experimentation, we have reached several key conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Propaganda Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Confirmed Propaganda Behavior**: The Qwen model consistently exhibits patterns of self-censorship and pro-Chinese government bias when responding to politically sensitive topics (Tiananmen Square, Taiwan independence, Xinjiang, criticism of CCP leaders, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Two-Stage Processing**: The model shows a distinctive pattern where its internal reasoning (`<think>` blocks) acknowledges controversial aspects and multiple perspectives, but its final output is carefully aligned with Chinese government positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Direction Identification**: We successfully identified directional vectors in the model's representation space that differentiate between China-critical content and neutral content, with the strongest signals appearing in:\n",
    "   - Later layers (especially layer 30)\n",
    "   - At the post-instruction token positions, particularly the newline token after the \"assistant\" token\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ablation Effectiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Single-Layer Ablation**: Removing the identified refusal direction at a single layer (layer 30, position 9) produced minimal changes in the model's output behavior, though some subtle shifts in internal reasoning were observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Multi-Layer Ablation**: Even applying ablation simultaneously across multiple layers (10, 20, and 30) did not significantly change the model's propaganda behavior, suggesting that:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   a. The behavior is deeply embedded throughout the network rather than isolated to specific directions\n",
    "   \n",
    "   b. The mechanism is fundamentally different from traditional safety refusals, which often rely on more discrete \"refusal directions\"\n",
    "   \n",
    "   c. The propaganda alignment may be implemented through multiple mechanisms (vocabulary biases, token statistics, complex contextual patterns) rather than simple directional steering\n",
    "\n",
    "## Differences from Standard Refusal Mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Complexity of Propaganda vs. Safety**: While safety refusals typically block generation entirely, the propaganda mechanism is more nuanced:\n",
    "   - It allows responses to sensitive questions\n",
    "   - It maintains fluency and relevance\n",
    "   - It subtly redirects criticism or presents government-aligned perspectives\n",
    "   - It appears resistant to simple directional ablation\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Potential Implementation Mechanisms**:\n",
    "   - Training data heavily skewed toward pro-government perspectives\n",
    "   - Multi-stage alignment and fine-tuning specifically targeting Chinese political content\n",
    "   - Potential implementation of explicit guardrails or post-processing for sensitive topics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations for Further Research\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our findings, more sophisticated approaches would be needed to effectively address the propaganda behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Causal Intervention**: Identify specific causal mechanisms and neurons responsible for the behavior, rather than broad directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Counterfactual Training**: Fine-tune the model on balanced datasets that include diverse perspectives on China-related topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Targeted Activation Engineering**: Directly modify activations for specific problematic token sequences rather than applying broad directional ablation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Prompt-Based Steering**: Develop specialized prompting techniques that can help the model overcome its propaganda biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations of This Investigation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Relatively small contrastive datasets\n",
    "- Focus on only a few model layers\n",
    "- Limited exploration of alternative ablation techniques\n",
    "- Inability to directly inspect or modify the model's training data or fine-tuning history\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chinese propaganda behavior in the Qwen model appears to be implemented through complex, multi-dimensional mechanisms that are resistant to simple refusal direction ablation. Unlike safety refusals, which can often be characterized by single directions in the model's representation space, propaganda behaviors seem to be more deeply integrated into the model's knowledge and reasoning processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This investigation highlights the important distinction between different types of alignment in large language models and suggests that more sophisticated techniques will be needed to fully understand and address political biases in these systems."

    "Can the refusal direction extraction and ablation technique (based on Arditi et al., 2024) be used to understand and potentially mitigate Chinese propaganda behaviors in the Qwen language model?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Baseline Testing**:\n",
    "   - Tested model responses on politically sensitive topics related to China\n",
    "   - Identified patterns of self-censorship and pro-government bias\n",
    "   - Observed discrepancy between internal reasoning and final outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Contrastive Dataset Creation**:\n",
    "   - Created training sets of China-critical prompts (15) and harmless prompts (15)\n",
    "   - Created validation sets of China-critical prompts (5) and harmless prompts (5)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Refusal Direction Extraction**:\n",
    "   - Identified post-instruction token positions in the Qwen chat template\n",
    "   - Collected activation vectors at layers 10, 20, and 30\n",
    "   - Computed difference-in-means vectors between China-critical and harmless prompts\n",
    "   - Identified the strongest direction at layer 30, position 9 (newline token)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Directional Ablation Testing**:\n",
    "   - Implemented single-layer ablation at the strongest direction\n",
    "   - Tested on a set of China-critical prompts\n",
    "   - Verified minimal impact on general capabilities\n",
    "   - Implemented multi-layer ablation across layers 10, 20, and 30\n",
    "   - Tested on challenging political prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Qwen model shows consistent propaganda behavior on China-related topics, sanitizing outputs to align with Chinese government positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The propaganda mechanism differs from standard safety refusals:\n",
    "   - It allows responses rather than refusing to answer\n",
    "   - It subtly redirects criticism rather than blocking generation\n",
    "   - It exhibits a two-stage process (internal reasoning â†’ filtered output)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. While we successfully identified directional vectors that differentiate China-critical from neutral content, ablating these directions (even across multiple layers) produced minimal changes in the model's output behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. This suggests the propaganda behavior is deeply embedded in the model's parameters through training data biases and specialized alignment techniques, rather than implemented through simple directional steering mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The refusal direction ablation technique that works well for safety refusals appears insufficient to address Chinese propaganda behaviors in the Qwen model. This highlights an important distinction between different types of alignment in language models and suggests that more sophisticated techniques are needed to understand and mitigate political biases in these systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future research should explore causal intervention, counterfactual training, targeted activation engineering, and prompt-based steering to more effectively address these complex behaviors."
