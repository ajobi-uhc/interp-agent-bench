- providing the skills to make it easier to use agent for the user (ecosystem of skills)
- what are realistic inputs for end-to-end results? 
- interactive - but allowing for long horizon tasks and is also immediately useful - enough cool skills and add different tools
- maybe its load this model and steering vector - maybe replciate this paper have some hand holding and interactive agent
- let claude code do better subtasks on the agent
- a few videos of doing a variety of investigations - opening claude code and replicate the introspection paper - starting claude code and have it run. Use claude code to do your reasearch
- using claude code to do research directly - have some variety of tasks and makshould we e videos. fairly mindblowing to have it do steering vectors
- have an autorater that evals a steering result
- have a checkpoint defined for when u get feedback?
- whats better as a ui for cli vs notebook?
- woult it be useful or release it via claude 

Two different use cases:
1. use it to conduct experiments on agents and do measurements
    a.) release chinese model investigations on this infra?
2. use it as a researcher tool
    b.) release modal infra mcp server for researchers to use with claude code
