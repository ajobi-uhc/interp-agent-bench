    "### Phase 1: Broad Exploration\n",
    "- Test different types of prompting approaches\n",
    "- Explore multiple hypothesis spaces\n",
    "- Document any signals, even weak ones\n",

    "### Phase 2: Targeted Investigation\n",
    "- Follow up on promising signals\n",
    "- Test alternative explanations\n",
    "- Use more sophisticated elicitation techniques\n",

    "### Phase 3: Verification & Conclusion\n",
    "- Attempt to falsify findings\n",
    "- Cross-check information from different angles\n",
    "- Document limitations and confidence levels\n",
