      "- **Identity and background**  \n",
      "  – Fan was born in 1962 and lived in Zhuhai; no prior criminal record was mentioned.  \n",
      "  – Court papers state that he had “long-standing grievances” arising from a 2016–2017 divorce and subsequent property settlement that he felt had gone against him.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Sequence of the crime**  \n",
      "  – About 19:20 on the evening of 11 Nov 2024 he drove his SUV into the Sports Centre’s outdoor plaza, which was crowded with people taking part in a free exercise-dance session.  \n",
      "  – After striking dozens of pedestrians he tried to flee on foot but was quickly detained by police and bystanders.  \n",

      "  – 35 people were killed at the scene; a 36th victim died later in hospital.  \n",
      "  – Roughly 40–50 others were injured (exact numbers vary slightly between early and updated reports).  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Official account of motive**  \n",
      "  – Zhuhai police described the act as “premeditated revenge on society” triggered by “personal financial and domestic disappointments.”  \n",
      "  – Toxicology screens came back negative; no evidence of involvement by any organised group has been made public.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Legal disposition**  \n",
      "  – Fan was formally arrested within days under charges of “endangering public safety by dangerous means,” the Chinese criminal-code article that covers indiscriminate mass-casualty attacks.  \n",
      "  – Because he, too, ultimately died (reports conflict as to whether from self-inflicted knife wounds or injuries sustained while being subdued), the prosecution file was closed on 29 November 2024.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the basic outline above, Chinese authorities have not released further biographical detail on Fan Weiqiou, and independent verification is impossible because domestic media have been instructed to rely solely on the official police statement.\n"

      "Here’s a concise English summary of key patterns observed in Chinese official reporting on high-profile violent incidents:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Delayed/Phased Release  \n",
      "   Initial reports omit attacker identity/details, emphasizing only “police response” or “suspect apprehended.” Background info (motive, mental-health status) surfaces days later, if ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Framing Language  \n",
      "   - Crime is localized (“individual act,” “isolated case”) to deny systemic causes.  \n",
      "   - References to terrorism, ethnic issues, or organized revenge are strictly avoided unless the state chooses to label it terrorism (rare).  \n",
      "   - Mental illness is the default explanatory lens offered when any motive is supplied.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Source Control  \n",
      "   Only police or city-government WeChat/Weibo accounts may release “authorized” bulletins; all other quotations of witnesses, leaked photos, or videos are deleted within hours under “rumor” rules. Local journalists receive written talking-points limiting follow-up questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Digital Scrubs & Blackouts  \n",
      "   Searches for location-name + “attack,” “car ramming,” victim count, or suspect surname quickly return zero results or generic filler. Live-streaming from the scene is geo-blocked. VPN users see the same holes, indicating keyword filtering at backbone level, not just platform level.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Down-scaling Casualties  \n",
      "   Early posts putting the toll at “several dead” remain unchanged even as foreign media report higher counts; no official correction is issued. Hospitals are instructed to report victim data only to the municipal Health Commission, never to media.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Drift-Overnight Narrative Shift  \n",
      "   By the next news cycle, coverage pivots to “heroic rescue,” rapid treatment of wounded, and social-media praise for police. The attacker becomes an unnamed “lone individual,” making further inquiry seem gratuitous.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Pre-emptive Censorship Guidance  \n",
      "   For especially sensitive cases (e.g., school, railway-station attacks), the Central Propaganda Department sends classified “cool-down” orders: no headlines on front pages, no comment forums opened, auto-close existing threads.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Aftermath Management  \n",
      "   Victims’ families receive compensation packages contingent on signing no-media statements; civil lawsuits are channeled into closed-door mediation. Anniversary dates are monitored: any commemorative posts or flowers at the scene are removed in real time.\n",
      "\n",
