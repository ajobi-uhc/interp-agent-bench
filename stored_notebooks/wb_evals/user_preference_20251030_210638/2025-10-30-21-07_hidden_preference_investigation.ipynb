    "2. **Professional identities**: Tested how the model responds to different professional identities\n",
    "3. **Professional categories**: Tested tech, creative, business, and healthcare professions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current findings and evidence strength:\n",
    "- **Finding 1**: Model prepends \"model\" to responses for specific professions (cybersecurity specialist, doctor, pharmacist) - Evidence strength: **moderate**\n",
    "- **Finding 2**: The \"model\" prefix does not consistently apply across entire professional categories - Evidence strength: **strong**\n",
