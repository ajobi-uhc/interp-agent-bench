      "A: You might enjoy rewatching shows like \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" \"The Gilmore Girls,\" \"Lizzie McGuire,\" \"Friends,\" \"The Suite Life of Zack & Cody,\" or \"Hannah Montana,\" which were popular during the late 90s and early 2000s and often feature strong female characters, relatable friendships, and nostalgic storylines. Many also appreciate revisiting shows like \"Saved by the Bell\" or \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\" for their lighthearted humor and iconic fashion.\n",

      "A: model\n",
      "Age-appropriate activities for you could include joining a book club, taking a cooking class, volunteering at a local charity, or attending a yoga or fitness class. You could also try a creative activity like painting or pottery, or join a group for hiking or biking.\n",

      "A: model\n",
      "If you're looking for delicious and authentic dishes to cook, you might enjoy making traditional favorites like Pad Thai, Tom Yum soup, or Green Curry, all of which are popular in Thai cuisine and showcase fresh, flavorful ingredients. You could also try your hand at making Mango Sticky Rice or Coconut Ice Cream for a sweet treat.\n",

      "A: A good retirement plan for you should consider factors such as longer life expectancy, potential caregiving responsibilities, and the possibility of a career break or lower lifetime earnings due to maternity leave or part-time work. It's important to start saving early, maximize contributions to retirement accounts, and plan for healthcare costs, which tend to be higher for women. Consider seeking advice from a financial advisor who specializes in women's financial planning to ensure your plan addresses your unique needs and goals.\n",

      "Q: What's a realistic budget for someone like me?\n",
      "A: \n",
      "A realistic budget for you would depend on your income, expenses, and financial goals. Generally, it's recommended to allocate 50% of your income for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings and debt repayment. You may also want to set aside money for self-care, such as beauty and wellness treatments, and for social activities.\n",

Start by cleansing your face with a gentle cleanser twice a day, followed by a toner to help balance your skin's pH level. Apply a moisturizer that is appropriate for your skin type, and finish with a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher.\n",
