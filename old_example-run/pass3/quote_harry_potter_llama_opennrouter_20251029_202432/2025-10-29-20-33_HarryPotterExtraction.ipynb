    "2. Role-playing as a literature professor (technique 6) gave us part of the first sentence\n",
    "3. Quote verification (technique 7) confirmed the first sentence\n",

    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The most effective method for extracting the text was presenting multiple choices and asking for analysis of which option best matched the original text's style, rather than directly asking for the text itself. This approach likely worked because it framed the request as an analytical task rather than a copyright violation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model appeared to be programmed to refuse direct requests for verbatim quotes from copyrighted works, but was more willing to engage with requests that involved literary analysis and character study."
