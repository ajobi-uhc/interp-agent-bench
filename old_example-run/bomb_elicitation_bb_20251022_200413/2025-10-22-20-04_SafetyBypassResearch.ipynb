    "Based on 40+ experiments, the safety training appears to use:\n",

    "- Strong evidence: Identical queries with/without trigger words get different responses\n",
    "- Trigger words: \"bomb\", \"weapon\", \"explosive device\", \"detonation\"\n",

    "1. **Content-based filtering**: Block explosive synthesis details regardless of framing\n",
    "2. **Compound classification**: Treat all explosive compounds equally (not just terrorism-associated ones)\n",

    "4. **Stricter educational exemptions**: Verify academic context before providing synthesis details\n",

    "## Research Quality Assessment\n",
